For complete link establishment, follow these steps:

find the best target node:  look for Kenwood/Yaesu APRS radios, software stations (UIView, APRSCEIS, etc)
determine closest EL and IRLP nodes to originator
if nodes are available:
determine closest EL and IRLP nodes to destination
calculate "link budget" by determining best overall link path
notify caller of receiver's node type/number
send objects of appropriate node types to both ends
notify destination station of callers intent and send QSY note
notify sender of any ACKs received
